        <p>
            This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. 
            You can substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety.

            My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, 
            and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! Serve over rice.
